# twitterbot

Welcome! This is the twitter bot that I made with the help of a youtube channel by the name of The Coding Train! The videos were about two years old but I was able to follow along and make a few changes to the twitter bot. My goal is to be able to make it retweet interesting content and reply to people! For now, it is being hosted on heroku and replies to new followers and posts a picture made in Processor every 12 hours. Also, I left out the config file so that my bot id isn't stolen by anybody.
